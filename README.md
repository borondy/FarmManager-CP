# FarmManager Solution

Welcome to the FarmManager solution! This project is designed to manage farms and their related operations through a structured architecture consisting of multiple projects.

## Project Structure

- **FarmManager.WebAPI**: This project contains the Web API that serves as the backend for the application. It handles HTTP requests and responses, providing endpoints for managing farm data.
  
- **FarmManager.Domain**: This project defines the core entities and business models used throughout the application. It includes the definitions of entities such as `Farm`.

- **FarmManager.Core**: This project contains the business logic and services that operate on the domain entities. It includes services like `FarmService` which encapsulate the operations related to farms.

- **FarmManager.Tests**: This project includes unit tests for the Web API and core services, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the application.

- **FarmManager.Frontend**: This project is the client-side application built using a lightweight library. It provides a user interface for interacting with the backend services.
